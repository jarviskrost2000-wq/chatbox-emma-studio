# 💬 Modular Chatbox App

A modular JavaScript web app that interacts with a **Chatbox API** to send user inputs and display AI-generated or text-based responses.  
This project demonstrates modern **JavaScript ES6 module architecture**, **asynchronous programming with async/await**, and **API integration** — all in a clean, scalable structure.
